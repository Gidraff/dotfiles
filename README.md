## Dotfiles

### Contents
This repo was initaily meant for hosting vim files. However, I diversified it to host other config and dotfiles (tmux.conf, vimrc
e.t.c).

### Getting started.
After cloning the repo, you will need to create a symlink to point to the location.

#### Prerequisites:
Install the following tools.
- git
- docker
- kubectl
- helm
- zsh
- vim
- tmux

##### Install Env
Run the `./install` to set up environment.

##### Clean Env
Run `./clean-env` to clean up environment.
